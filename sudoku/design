cells - ARRAY OF A STRUCT
struct cell* cells = malloc(81)

sizeOfBoard - INT (i.e. 2 = 2x2, 3 = 3x3)

struct cell {
       int possibleValues[9]
       char value
       char default == 1 : true, 0 : false

FUNCTIONS

printBoard
	- Prints out the current state of the board
loadBoard
	- Loads a board from a file
saveBoard
	- Saves the current board to a file
getUserInput
	- Gets the user input and checks the validity of it
checkValidityOfNumber
	- MOD BY 9 gives column number
	- DIVIDE BY 3 gives row number
	- Use these two tools to checkRow, checkColumn, and checkBox
checkRow
	- Checks if given value is in current row
checkColumn
	- Checks if given value is in current column
checkBox
	- Checks if given value is in current box
computePossibleValues
	- Checks the possible values of all cells
eraseCell
	- Erases the value of a given cell.
eraseBoard
	- Erases all of the cell's values except the default cells
fillCell
	- Fills a cell with a given value
checkBounds
	- Check the bounds of given coordinates of a cell

5. Validate User Input (make sure it is a valid option and make sure that the cell information is valid [i.e. cell location is not out of bounds and cell is not empty and value is valid])

6. Go to (4) if invalid and display error message otherwise continue on.

7. Compute option and go to (4). Unless option was (q)uit --> If option is to save board. Save to a file of a name that the user specifies. Then continue. --> If option is to erase value from a cell and is not a default cell,
   erase cell value and recompute possibleValues. --> If option was to put a value into a cell and the cell is non-empty, not a default cell, and is in bounds, then fill in the cell with the value and recompute possibleValues.
   --> POSSIBLE OPTION: Restart. This will erase board and start from scratch.
